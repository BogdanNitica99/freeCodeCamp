            <h2>About</h2>

            <div class="content">
              Dead Winter Dead is the ninth studio album by the American heavy
              metal band Savatage, released in 1995. It is a concept album,
              dealing with a Serb boy and a Muslim girl who fall in love. The
              story of the album also focused on the Bosnian War, which was
              ongoing at the time. <br />
              <br />
              In the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo, there is a town square
              surrounded by buildings that were constructed during the Middle
              Ages. The square has a beautiful stone fountain at its center and
              at one corner there is a thousand year old church with a gargoyle
              carved into its belfry. This gargoyle, for the last thousand
              years, has spent all his time trying to comprehend the human
              emotions of laughter and sorrow, but even after a millennium of
              contemplation, these most curious of human attributes remain a
              total mystery to him. Our story begins in the year of 1990; the
              Berlin Wall has just fallen, communism has collapsed and for the
              first time since the Roman Empire, Yugoslavia finds itself a free
              nation. Serdjan Aleskovic cannot believe his good fortune to be
              alive and young at such a moment. The future and the happiness of
              all seem assured in what must surely be "the best of times"
              ("Sarajevo", "This Is the Time").
