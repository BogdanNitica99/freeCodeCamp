          Git is software for tracking changes in any set of files, usually used
          for coordinating work among programmers collaboratively developing
          source code during software development. Its goals include speed, data
          integrity, and support for distributed, non-linear workflows
          (thousands of parallel branches running on different systems). Git was
          created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel,
          with other kernel developers contributing to its initial development.
          Since 2005, Junio Hamano has been the core maintainer.
        </p>
        <p>
          As with most other distributed version control systems, and unlike
          most clientâ€“server systems, every Git directory on every computer is a
          full-fledged repository with complete history and full
          version-tracking abilities, independent of network access or a central
          server. Git is free and open-source software distributed under GNU
          General Public License Version 2.

          Git's design is a synthesis of Torvalds's experience with Linux in
          maintaining a large distributed development project, along with his
          intimate knowledge of file-system performance gained from the same
          project and the urgent need to produce a working system in short
          order. These influences led to the following implementation choices:
        </p>
        <li>Strong support for non-linear development</li>
        <li>Distributed development</li>
        <li>Compatibility with existent systems and protocols</li>
        <li>Efficient handling of large projects</li>
        <li>Cryptographic authentication of history</li>

          Git (the main implementation in C) is primarily developed on Linux,
          although it also supports most major operating systems, including BSD,
          Solaris, macOS, and Windows. The first Windows port of Git was
          primarily a Linux-emulation framework that hosts the Linux version.
          Installing Git under Windows creates a similarly named Program Files
          directory containing the Mingw-w64 port of the GNU Compiler
          Collection, Perl 5, MSYS2 (itself a fork of Cygwin, a Unix-like
          emulation environment for Windows) and various other Windows ports or
          emulations of Linux utilities and libraries. Currently, native Windows
          builds of Git are distributed as 32- and 64-bit installers. The git
          official website currently maintains a build of Git for Windows, still
          using the MSYS2 environment.

          The JGit implementation of Git is a pure Java software library,
          designed to be embedded in any Java application. JGit is used in the
          Gerrit code-review tool, and in EGit, a Git client for the Eclipse
          IDE.
        </p>

        <p>
          Go-git is an open-source implementation of Git written in pure Go. It
          is currently used for backing projects as a SQL interface for Git code
          repositories and providing encryption for Git. The Dulwich
          implementation of Git is a pure Python software component for Python
          2.7, 3.4 and 3.5
        </p>

        <p>
          The libgit2 implementation of Git is an ANSI C software library with
          no other dependencies, which can be built on multiple platforms,
          including Windows, Linux, macOS, and BSD. It has bindings for many
          programming languages, including Ruby, Python, and Haskell.

          Git does not provide access-control mechanisms, but was designed for
          operation with other tools that specialize in access control.

          On 17 December 2014, an exploit was found affecting the Windows and
          macOS versions of the Git client. An attacker could perform arbitrary
          code execution on a target computer with Git installed by creating a
          malicious Git tree (directory) named .git (a directory in Git
          repositories that stores all the data of the repository) in a
          different case (such as .GIT or .Git, needed because Git does not
          allow the all-lowercase version of .git to be created manually) with
          malicious files in the .git/hooks subdirectory (a folder with
          executable files that Git runs) on a repository that the attacker made
          or on a repository that the attacker can modify. If a Windows or Mac
          user pulls (downloads) a version of the repository with the malicious
          directory, then switches to that directory, the .git directory will be
          overwritten (due to the case-insensitive trait of the Windows and Mac
          filesystems) and the malicious executable files in .git/hooks may be
          run, which results in the attacker's commands being executed. An
          attacker could also modify the .git/config configuration file, which
          allows the attacker to create malicious Git aliases (aliases for Git
          commands or external commands) or modify extant aliases to execute
          malicious commands when run. The vulnerability was patched in version
          2.2.1 of Git, released on 17 December 2014, and announced the next
          day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git version 2.6.1, released on 29 September 2015, contained a patch
          for a security vulnerability (CVE-2015-7545) that allowed arbitrary
          code execution. The vulnerability was exploitable if an attacker could
          convince a victim to clone a specific URL, as the arbitrary commands
          were embedded in the URL itself. An attacker could use the exploit via
          a man-in-the-middle attack if the connection was unencrypted, as they
          could redirect the user to a URL of their choice. Recursive clones
          were also vulnerable, since they allowed the controller of a
          repository to specify arbitrary URLs via the gitmodules file.
        </p>
        <p>
          Git uses SHA-1 hashes internally. Linus Torvalds has responded that
          the hash was mostly to guard against accidental corruption, and the
          security a cryptographically secure hash gives was just an accidental
          side effect, with the main security being signing elsewhere. Since a
          demonstration of the SHAttered attack against git in 2017, git was
          modified to use a SHA-1 variant resistant to this attack. A plan for
          hash function transition is being written since February 2020.
